# Mixtura
 
It is clear that artificial intelligence will play a fundamental role in the generation and modification of content, radically transforming the way we create, consume and interact with content. Whether it's text, images, video or even music, AI is already automating previously complex processes, while opening up new creative possibilities.

However, for many users, using AI can be complex. *"How do I do it? What should I do? I don't understand a thing! It's far too complex for me"*, these are some of the answers from people close to me when I asked them about their use of AI.

It is clear today that we are witnessing a growing digital divide between those who have mastered new technologies, and in particular artificial intelligence, and those who feel overwhelmed by them.

One of the main obstacles to the mass adoption of these technologies is therefore the perceived complexity, but also mistrust of the conditions of use and ethical implications that these tools raise, not to mention financial reasons. Many users are reluctant to start using artificial intelligence for fear of losing control over their creation or having their privacy compromised. Questions around intellectual property, data confidentiality and the possibility of large companies exploiting works created using these tools are all obstacles to their democratisation.

That's why Mixtura was created, to provide an image-modification tool that respects users, their level of knowledge, their wallets and their private lives.
